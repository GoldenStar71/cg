# Requirements

To develop a responsive single page application (SPA) that mimics a real-world candle and flame.

## SPA details
1.	The application is a virtual candle app where user can start a candle with a lit flame and adjust properties of the candle like wax color, flame size, flame animation etc.

1.	The SPA will consist of 3 routes (/home, /about, /candle)

1.  Wireframe [**pics**](https://github.com/ksivane/cg/blob/master/cg_fl_wireframes1.zip)

1.	For wireframes and functionality, see [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/) file [**cg_fl_wireframes1**](https://github.com/ksivane/cg/blob/master/cg_fl_wireframes1.bmpr). Please install free edition of Balsamiq to open the file. 

1.	For the /candle page, please use existing resources at [**codepen**](https://codepen.io/Shorina/pen/VbepBe). The developer needs to develop additional logic to control the candle and flame attributes as per requirements in the wireframes.

1.	Tech stack
    - Html, Css and Javascript
    - Framework: Vue
    - UI Kit: This is up to the developer. The UI needs to look uniform across all target platforms. So, platform independent UI components are to be used. E.g. MDB bootstrap for [**vue**](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/vue/).
  
1.	Target platforms: 
    - Latest desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari
    - For mobile devices, the app will be packaged with [**PhoneGap**](https://phonegap.com/) to run on Android 8.0 and above, and iOS 11 and above.

## Others:
- Wireframes are guidelines only. If the developer feels certain UI components can be changed or overall UI/UX can be improved, he/she is feel to recommend such modifications. Please use free edition of Balsamiq to wireframe the modifications.
- App does not use any server-side support, so backend is not needed.

## Deliverables
The project is divided into three milestones.

**Milestone I**
- Developer to use codepen to demonstrate at-least one feature of the candle. (e.g. Changing the flame size of the candle from small to medium to big)

**Milestone II**
- Working application as per agreed design and functionality
- Demo the application on target browsers
- Source codes, static assets and other resources of the application
- Source codes with comments & basic documentation
    
**Milestone III** (Optional, can be discussed after M1 and M2 are complete)
- Import project into PhoneGap
- Demo the application on Android device (using [**PhoneGap developer app**](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/developer-app/)) as per agreed design and functionality
- Source codes, static assets and other resources of the application
- Source codes with comments & basic documentation

## Timeline
Total duration: 2 weeks
